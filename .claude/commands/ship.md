Stage all changes, commit with a descriptive message, and push to origin.

Steps:
1. Run `git status` to see what changed
2. Run `git diff --staged` and `git diff` to understand the changes
3. Run `git log --oneline -3` to match the repo's commit message style
4. Stage all relevant changed files (do NOT use `git add -A` or `git add .`; add files by name)
5. Write a concise commit message summarizing what changed and why
6. Commit the changes
7. Push to origin
8. Report the commit hash and pushed branch
